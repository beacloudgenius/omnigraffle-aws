Omnigraffle stencils using AWS Simple Icons.

## Overview
I've found many stencils for Omnigraffle based off of [AWS Simple Icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/). However many seem out of date or disorganized. This is my attempt at creating stencils that I'll continually update. The first stencils are based off of AWS Simple Icons version **17.10.18**.

## Details

  * Stencils were created from the EPS files.
  * Corrected the AWS CodeDeploy icon using the SVG file.
  * Removed duplicates when found.
  * Each area has is its own stencil.
  * Object names match AWS Simple Icons file names.
  * Groups were imported from the AWS Visio pack.

## Installation
  * Clone this repository:
  * Drag and drop the `AWS` directory into your `Stencils` folder.
    * See further details from [Omnigraffle](https://www.graffletopia.com/install#mac).

## Tips
  * All icons are the same size with 8 magnets.
  * When connecting via lines, I'd recommend:
    * Set a stroke on the icons, perhaps a light gray.
    * Add a bit of shadow.
    * Create a text object, align and center below if text is desired.

Amazon created the icons that these stencils are based off of. Credit goes to them!

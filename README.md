Omnigraffle stencils using AWS Simple Icons.

## Overview
I've found many stencils for Omnigraffle based off of [AWS Simple Icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/). However many seem out of date or disorganized. This is my attempt at creating stencils that I'll continually update. The first upload stencils are based off of AWS Simple Icons downloaded in November 2017.

## Details

  * Stencils were created from the EPS files.
  * Corrected the AWS CodeDeploy icon using the SVG file.
  * Removed duplicates when found.
  * Each area has is its own stencil.
  * Object names match AWS Simple Icons file names.

## Installation
  * In an nutshell, drag and drop them into your Stencils folder.
  * See further details from [Omnigraffle](https://www.graffletopia.com/install#mac).

## Disclaimer
Amazon created these icons, not I. All credit is theirs. I just did cleanup and created Omnigraffle stencils for the benefit of all.
